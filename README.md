# Vehicle-Classification

This project implements a vehicle classification system using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the Stanford Car Dataset. The model identifies the make and model of vehicles in various conditions.


**Technical Implementation**

Custom model architecture with convolutional and pooling layers

Data preprocessing using Keras ImageDataGenerator

Emphasis on model accuracy and performance
